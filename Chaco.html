                <p><h2>Distribution</h2><br>One of the larger species of tarantula, the Chaco golden
                knee (Grammostola pulchripes), formerly known by Grammostola aureostriata, can be
                expected to reach between 20–22 cm (8.5 in).</p>

                <p><h2>Description and Behavior</h2><br> The Chaco golden knee is a large tarantula,
                being able to reach between 7 and 8 inches in legspan (17.8-20.3 cm). Being a
                terrestrial tarantula, it has a heavy body. Mature males have longer legs and smaller
                bodies than females, and they possess tibial hooks or apophyses to hold back a female's
                fangs during mating. Males also possess modified pedipalps to insert sperm into the female's
                genital operculum. It exhibits a multitude of colors, with bright yellowish leg stripes,
                dark black "femurs", and pink hairs all over its body. As with the rest of the genus
                Grammostola, the Chaco golden knee has very large fangs, and the carapace (the top of
                the prosoma) is raised to make room for the large chelicerae. It has rudimentary eyesight,
                and senses its environment with the setae all over its body, feeling vibrations through
                the ground and air, and picking up chemical signatures, similar to a sense of smell.</p>

                <p><h2>Natural Habitat</h2><br> The Chaco golden knee tarantulas are known to inhabit
                the grasslands of Argentina and Paraguay. As such, they are adapted to generally warm
                climate, with alternating dry and rainy seasons.</p>

                <p><h2>As a Pet</h2><br> The Chaco golden knee is a very calm and docile tarantula, which,
                along with its striking appearance and large size, makes it an attractive pet, especially
                for beginners. It frequently sits in plain view in captivity, and likes to shove substrate
                around, especially at young ages. Females can live for well over twenty years, while males
                only live for about five or six years. The tarantula must periodically molt its exoskeleton
                to grow larger, and it is vulnerable during this time. This can happen every few weeks for
                newborn spiderlings or every few years for large adults. The Chaco golden knee tends to be
                one of the more docile and calm species of tarantula and therefore makes an attractive first
                pet. The Chaco is an opportunistic burrowing terrestrial tarantula: they tend to burrow while
                younger and adopt a pre-existing hide as its home when it begins to mature. It is quite
                flashy in appearance, bearing long light-colored hairs all over its body and gold stripes
                on its legs, particularly at the "knees". This is a good display species as it often sits in
                plain view. When it was first imported into the pet trade, it was thought to be a variant of
                the Pink zebra beauty species, but it is significantly larger and can easily be distinguished
                by the size difference, with the most notable comparative feature being the leg-span, though
                an experienced owner could distinguish the colouring.</p>
