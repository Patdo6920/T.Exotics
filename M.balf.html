                <p><h2>Distribution</h2><br> Monocentropus balfouri Pocock, 1897, also known as
                “Socotra island blue baboon”, is a very remarkable bird spider due to its coloration and
                behavior from Socotra-island, part of the Republic of Yemen. However she’s been linked with
                baboon spiders, she belongs to the subfamily of the Eumenophorinae and not the Harpactirinae.
                African bird spiders are commonly given the title of baboon spider, which explains why she
                carries the name. The species is very popular amongst hobbyists, because of their cuddly
                appearance and communal capabilities. In 2014 she was even voted the most beautiful bird spider
                on earth. More than 30 spiders have been described, but Atrophothele socotrana and
                Monocentropus balfouri are the only endemic species from Socotra belonging to the suborder of the
                Mygalomorphae. Variants in coloration, from red to amber, have been found in 1999 and 2003.
                However this is very exceptional, it’s the same species slowly transforming into a beauty
                with colors as seen on the photo.</p>
