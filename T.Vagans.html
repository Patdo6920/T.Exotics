                <p><h3>Tliltocatl Vagans</h3><br> Tliltocatl vagans (synonym Brachypelma vagans) is a species
                of tarantula known commonly as the Mexican red rump. It ranges predominantly in Mexico (including
                the Yucat√°n Peninsula), but is also found in Central America. They are terrestrial, burrowing spiders.
                The reason for the name red rump is because of its distinctive red hairs on its abdomen. Like most
                tarantulas, they will eat anything they can overpower, which is usually insects, but small lizards
                and rodents may also be consumed. They can grow up to a solid 6.5 inch leg span, with males typically
                being smaller and thinner than the females. They prefer shrubland habitats.In 1996, Tliltocatl vagans
                was discovered in the wild in St. Lucie County, Florida. It is now considered an established non-native
                species in that state, where it is thought to have been introduced through either accidental or
                intentional releases of specimens imported via the pet trade, although their numbers have been dwindling
                due to many T. vagans eating insects poisoned by pesticides.</p>

                <p><h3>In traditional Mayan Medicine</h3><br> The Ch'ol Maya consider these spiders to be positive,
                and use them medicinally. A hierbatero kills it, then crushes it, mixes it with spirit alcohol and
                strains out any irritating hairs with a traditional cloth. The beverage is used for the treatment of
                "tarantula wind", the symptoms being chest pain, coughing and asthma. The venom peptide GsMtx-4 is being
                investigated for the possible treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, muscular dystrophy and glioma.</p>

                <p><h3>In Captivity</h3><br> T. vagans is frequently kept and bred in captivity. They are typically
                docile, though they can be skittish and prone to releasing urticating hairs. Females are long-lived,
                potentially reaching 15 years of age. Due to its popularity in the pet trade, T. vagans is listed under
                appendix II of CITES (under its former name) to prevent illegal removal and international trade. This
                trade, combined with habitat destruction and a high rate of mortality prior to sexual maturity, means
                that T. vagans is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
