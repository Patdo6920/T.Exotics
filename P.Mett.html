                <p><h3>Poecilotheria Mettallica</h3><br>Poecilotheria metallica, also known as the Gooty
                sapphire ornamental, is an Old World species of tarantula. It is the only blue species of the
                genus Poecilotheria. Like others in its genus it exhibits an intricate fractal-like pattern
                on the abdomen. The species' natural habitat is deciduous forest in Andhra Pradesh, in central
                southern India. It has been classified as Critically endangered by the IUCN. </p>

                <p><h3>Description</h3><br> Poecilotheria metallica has similar intricate geometric body coloration
                as other Poecilotheria species, but it is the only species in the genus to be covered in blue hair.
                While it is young, P. metallica is less chromatic, the coloring turns to blue as it matures. This
                blue is much less significant in the mature males. Males also have more slender bodies, and their
                legs are longer. The definitive trait of a mature male are the revelation of emboli at the end of
                their pedipalps following their "mature molt". Females can be determined through molt confirmations
                before maturity. When full size, the leg span of P. metallica is 15–20 cm (6–8 in).</p>

                <p><h3>Distribution</h3><br> Poecilotheria metallica is found only in a small area of less than 100
                square kilometres (39 sq mi), a reserve forest that is nonetheless highly disturbed. Surveys of
                adjacent forest have failed to observe this species. The type specimen was discovered in a railway
                timber yard in Gooty about 100 km southwest of its known range, but it is believed to have been
                transported there by train.</p>

                <p><h3>Behavior</h3><br> Poecilotheria metallica's behavior parallels that of many arboreal spiders.
                In the wild, P. metallica lives in holes of tall trees where it makes asymmetric funnel webs. The
                primary prey consists of various flying insects. Spiders of this genus may live communally when
                territory, i.e. the number of holes per tree, is limited. The species is skittish and will try to
                flee first, and will also flee when light shines upon it, as it is a photosensitive species. Under
                provocation, however, members of the species may bite.</p>

                <p><h3>Longevity</h3><br> Females typically live for 11 to 12 years, or, in rare instances, for
                up to 15 years. Males live for 3 to 4 years.</p>

                <p><h3>Venom</h3><br> There has never been a recorded human death from its bite. However, P. metallica's
                bite is considered medically significant, with venom that may cause intense pain, judging from the
                experience of keepers bitten by other spiders in the genus. The vast majority are "dry bites,"
                where no venom is injected into the handler. The mechanical effects of the bite can still be worrisome,
                as an adult's fangs can reach nearly 3/4 of an inch in length. P. metallica can move rapidly and may
                defend itself when cornered. Venom may produce a heart-rate increase followed by sweating, headache,
                stinging, cramping, or swelling. Effects can last for up to a week. However in extreme bites from the
                genus Poecilotheria, effects may still be felt months later.</p>

                <p><h3>Coloration</h3><br> As with other tarantulas with blue hair, the vivid colors of P. metallica
                are produced by crystalline arrays of nanostructures. Structural colours are usually highly
                iridescent, changing color when viewed from different angles. Some species of blue tarantulas have
                hairs with a "special flower-like" structure which may reduce iridescence.</p>

                <p><h3>As Pets</h3><br> P. metallica has been bred in captivity for ten years and is popular with
                tarantula enthusiasts. It sometimes priced above $500 in the United States, but as a spiderling is
                typically between $100 and $200. As with most tarantulas, the spider's sex can influence price -
                females generally being more expensive because of their longer life. Members of the species are hardy,
                relatively fast-growing spiders that are generally fed crickets, but may also eat moths, grasshoppers
                and cockroaches. P. metallica measures between 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) in legspan when fully grown.
                In captivity, humid environments with temperatures between 18 to 24 °C (64 to 75 °F) and a humidity
                level of 75 to 85% are preferred.<br> This is a very fast, sometimes defensive tarantula that has the
                potential for medically significant venom.</p>
