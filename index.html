                <h2>About Tarantulas</h2>
	            <p>Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often ″hairy″ spiders of the family Theraphosidae
	            (technically, spiders possess setae, not true hairs). Currently, about 1,000 species have been identified.
	            The term tarantula is usually used to describe members of the family Theraphosidae, although many other
	            members of the same infraorder (Mygalomorphae) are commonly referred to as "tarantulas" or "false tarantulas".
	            Some of the more common species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. Many New World species kept as
	            pets have urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, cause damage to the
	            eyes.</p>

	            <p> Like all arthropods, the tarantula is an invertebrate that relies on an exoskeleton for muscular support.
	            Like other Arachnida, a tarantula’s body comprises two main parts, the prosoma (or cephalothorax) and the
            	opisthosoma (or abdomen). The prosoma and opisthosoma are connected by the pedicel, or pregenital somite.
	            This waist-like connecting piece is actually part of the prosoma and gives the opisthosoma a wide range of
	            motion relative to the prosoma. Tarantula sizes can range from as small as the size of a BB Pellet to as
	            large as a dinner plate when the legs are fully extended. Depending on the species, the body length of
	            tarantulas ranges from 0.180 to 4.33071 in (5 to 110 mm), with leg spans of 8–30 cm (3–12 in). Leg span is
	            determined by measuring from the tip of the back leg to the tip of the front leg on the opposite side.
	            Some of the largest species of tarantula may weigh over 85 g (3 oz); the largest of all, the goliath
	            birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) from Venezuela and Brazil, has been reported to attain a weight of 170 g
	            (6.0 oz) and a leg-span up to 30 cm (12 in), males being longer and females greater in girth. The fang size
	            of this tarantula reaches a maximum of 3.8 cm (1.5 in). Theraphosa apophysis (the pinkfoot goliath) was
	            described 187 years after the goliath birdeater, so its characteristics are not as well attested. T. blondi
	            is generally thought to be the heaviest tarantula, and T. apophysis has the greatest leg span. Two other
	            species, Lasiodora parahybana (the Brazilian salmon birdeater) and Lasiodora klugi, rival the size of the
	            two goliath spiders.</p>

	            <p> Most species of North American tarantulas are brown. Elsewhere, species have been found that variously
	            display cobalt blue (Cyriopagopus lividus), black with white stripes (Aphonopelma seemanni),
	            yellow leg markings (Eupalaestrus campestratus), metallic blue legs with vibrant orange abdomen and green
	            prosoma (Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens). Their natural habitats include savanna, grassland such as in the
	            pampas, rainforest, desert, scrubland, mountains, and cloud forest. They are generally classed among the
	            terrestrial types. They are burrowers that live in the ground.Tarantulas are becoming increasingly popular
	            as pets and some species are readily available in captivity.</p>

	            <p>The eight legs, the two chelicerae with their fangs, and the pedipalps are attached to the prosoma.
	            The chelicerae are two double-segmented appendages located just below the eyes and directly forward of the
	            mouth. The chelicerae contain the venom glands that vent through the fangs. The fangs are hollow extensions
	            of the chelicerae that inject venom into prey or animals that the tarantula bites in defense, and they are
	            also used to masticate. These fangs are articulated so that they can extend downward and outward in
	            preparation to bite or can fold back toward the chelicerae as a pocket knife blade folds back into its handle.
	            The chelicerae of a tarantula completely contain the venom glands and the muscles that surround them, and can
	            cause the venom to be forcefully injected into prey.The pedipalpi are two six-segmented appendages connected
	            to the prosoma near the mouth and protruding on either side of both chelicerae. In most species of tarantulas,
	            the pedipalpi contain sharp, jagged plates used to cut and crush food often called the coxae or maxillae.
	            As with other spiders, the terminal portions of the pedipalpi of males function as part of their reproductive
	            system. Male spiders spin a silken platform (sperm web) on the ground onto which they release semen from
	            glands in their opisthosoma. Then they insert their pedipalps into the semen, absorb the semen into the
	            pedipalps, and later insert the pedipalps (one at a time) into the reproductive organ of the female, which is
	            located in her abdomen. The terminal segments of the pedipalps of male tarantulas are moderately larger in
	            circumference than those of a female tarantula. Male tarantulas have special spinnerets surrounding the
	            genital opening. Silk for the sperm web of the tarantula is exuded from these special spinnerets.</p>

	            <p>A tarantula has four pairs of legs and two additional pairs of appendages. Each leg has seven segments,
	            which from the prosoma out are: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, tarsus and pretarsus, and claw. Two
	            or three retractable claws at the end of each leg are used to grip surfaces for climbing. Also on the end of
	            each leg, surrounding the claws, is a group of bristles, called the scopula, which help the tarantula to grip
	            better when climbing surfaces such as glass. The fifth pair is the pedipalps, which aid in feeling, gripping
	            prey, and mating in the case of a mature male. The sixth pair of appendages is the chelicerae and their
	            attached fangs. When walking, a tarantula's first and third legs on one side move at the same time as the
	            second and fourth legs on the other side of its body. The muscles in a tarantula's legs cause the legs to
	            bend at the joints, but to extend a leg, the tarantula increases the pressure of haemolymph entering the leg.
	            Tarantulas, like almost all other spiders, have their primary spinnerets at the end of the opisthosoma.
	            Unlike most spider species in the infraorder Araneomorphae, which includes the majority of extant spider
	            species, and most of which have six, tarantula species have two or four spinnerets. Spinnerets are flexible,
	            tube-like structures from which the spider exudes its silk. The tip of each spinneret is called the spinning
	            field. Each spinning field is covered by as many as 100 spinning tubes through which silk is exuded. As the
	            silk is pulled out of the spinnerets, the shear forces cause proteins in the silk to crystallize, transforming
	            it from a liquid to a solid thread.</p>

                <h2>Tarantula</h2>
	            <p>Tarantulas give some people the creeps because of their large, hairy bodies and legs. <br>But these spiders
	            are harmless to humans (except for a painful bite), and their mild venom is weaker than a typical bee's.<br>
	            Among arachnid enthusiasts, these spiders have become popular pets.</p>

	            <h2>Molting</h2>
	            <p> Tarantulas periodically shed their external skeletons in a process called molting. <br>In the process,
	            they also replace internal organs, such as female genitalia and stomach lining,
	            <br>and even regrow lost appendages.</p>

                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>There are hundreds of tarantula species found in most of the world's tropical, subtropical, and arid
                regions.<br>They vary in color and behavior according to their specific environments. Generally, however, tarantulas
                <br>are burrowers that live in the ground.</p>

                <h2>Hunting</h2>
                <p>Tarantulas are slow and deliberate movers, but accomplished nocturnal predators. Insects are their
                main prey, but they also target bigger game, including frogs, toads, and mice. <br>The South American
                bird-eating spider, as it name suggests, is even able to prey upon small birds.
                A tarantula doesn't use a web to ensnare prey, though it may spin a trip wire to signal an alert when
                something approaches its burrow. <br>These spiders grab with their appendages, inject paralyzing venom, and
                dispatch their unfortunate victims with their fangs. They also secrete digestive enzymes to liquefy their
                victims' bodies so that they can suck them up through their straw-like mouth openings.<br> After a large meal,
                the tarantula may not need to eat for a month.</p>

                <h2>Natural Threats</h2>
                <p>Tarantulas have few natural enemies, but parasitic pepsis wasps are a formidable exception. Such a wasp
                <br>will paralyze a tarantula with its sting and lay its eggs on the spider's body. When the eggs hatch, wasp
                <br>larvae gorge themselves on the still living tarantula.</p>

                <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                <p>he tarantula's own mating ritual begins when the male spins a web and deposits sperm on its surface.<br>
                He copulates by using his pedipalps (short, leglike appendages located near the mouth) and then scuttles
                away if he can—females sometimes eat their mates.<br>Females seal both eggs and sperm in a cocoon and guard
                it for six to nine weeks, when some 500 to 1,000 tarantulas hatch.</p>
