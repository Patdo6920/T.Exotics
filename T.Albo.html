                <p><h3>Tliltocatl Albopilosum</h3><br> Tliltocatl albopilosus (previously Brachypelma albopilosum)
                is a species of tarantula, also known as the curlyhair tarantula. The species' native range is Nicaragua
                and Costa Rica. They are terrestrial, opportunistic burrowing spiders. This tarantula is covered in
                long bristles that have a characteristic curl to them giving them a unique look.</p>

                <p><h3>Description</h3><br> The curlyhair tarantula is a plump-bodied spider, covered with dark brown
                to black bristles that start light in coloration at a during juvenile years and darken as the tarantula
                ages. It has a golden-bronze sheen due to longer gold bristles that cover the whole body, which are
                particularly dense on the hind legs. In captivity both male and female specimens have grown to have a
                leg span of just over 6 inches, however, males live a shorter life at only 5 years in captivity opposed
                to females reportedly living up to 20 years. Males are often a lighter bronze color than females.</p>

                <p><h3>Range and Habitat</h3><br> Tliltocatl albopilosus is native to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. A
                burrowing species, the curlyhair tarantula is found in tropical scrubland, either around the base of
                large trees, near rivers, or in patches of cleared rain forest.</p>

                <p><h3>Conservation</h3><br> The largest threat to the curlyhair tarantula is now habitat loss. Once
                captured in large numbers for the international pet trade, the curlyhair tarantula is now bred in
                captivity worldwide and relatively few are caught in the wild. Listed on Appendix II of the
                Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the curlyhair tarantula can now only
                be traded internationally according to quotas and with trade permits.</p>

                <p><h3>As Pets</h3><br> T. albopilosus is frequently kept and bred in captivity. They are highly
                adaptable to humidity and temperature changes and they feed readily on commercially available crickets,
                superworms, cockroaches and even small mice. They are typically docile. Females live potentially between
                8 - 10 years of age and Males roughly 4 years.</p>
