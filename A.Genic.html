                <p><h3>Distribution and habitat</h3><br>
                A. geniculata is native to the Amazon basin of northern Brazil.
                These tarantulas live in a tropical, wet climate, characterized by abundant
                rainfall with little to no dry season.</p>

                <p><h3>Description</h3><br>Its body and legs are a deep black color,
                though occasionally the legs may be slightly lighter in coloration. This contrasts
                the bright white bands on its legs, which are generally considered to be the main
                eason for its subjective beauty. The males are smaller and less intensely colored.<br>
                This is a larger species of tarantula than the norm, with the length of the body
                reaching up to 9 centimetres (3.5 in). These tarantulas are fast growing, usually
                taking around 3â€“4 years to reach a mature leg-span of 8.5 inches for females.</p>

                <p><h3>As pets</h3><br>These tarantulas have been much prized as pets, due to their size,
                hardiness, and striking coloration. They are usually somewhat defensive, and their
                urticating hairs can be quite irritating to human skin, as with most other tarantulas
                found in the Americas.<br>These spiders, like many undomesticated pets, can bite when provoked.
                However, as they have urticating hairs, biting is typically not their first line of defense.<br>
                Their venom is not considered medically significant, but due to their large size, they can cause
                mechanical damage.</p>
