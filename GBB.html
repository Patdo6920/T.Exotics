                <p><h3>GreenBottle Blue tarantula</h3><br> Chromatopelma is a monotypic genus of
                South American tarantulas containing the single species, Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens.
                Commonly known as greenbottle blue tarantulas due to their metallic blue legs and blue-green
                carapace, they are very active and fast-growing tarantulas that are particularly attractive
                to hobbyists. They are native to the Paraguan√° Peninsula, near Punto Fijo. They live in
                webbed burrows under bushes and tree roots in desert areas of northern Venezuela. The
                entrance is often extended with webbing, sometimes resembling a funnel shape. These webs
                may protect the entrance from the harsh desert climate and act as a trap for insects.</p>
