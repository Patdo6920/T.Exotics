                <p><h2>Distribution</h2><br>Ceratogyrus darlingi (commonly called burst horned baboon
                tarantula or African rear-horned baboon tarantula, synonym Ceratogyrus bechuanicus) is
                a theraphosid spider from southern Africa, mainly Botswana and Lesotho.<br> They reach a
                body length of about 5 inches (130 mm) and are ash-gray, mud-brown to black. The
                peltidium features a black foveal horn.</p>

                <p><h2>As pets</h2><br>C. darlingi, often still known under its obsolete name C. bechuanicus,
                is the most common Ceratogyrus species held in captivity, although it is very aggressive and
                fast. When kept in captivity, it requires dry substrate, such as coconut fiber, on which to
                live. This allows it to burrow, and also will allow it to avoid fungal infection. They are
                obligatory burrowers. As this species is from a very arid habitat, it cannot cope with too
                much moisture. They will readily take crickets, roaches and superworms but tend to shy away
                from large prey items. Food is usually pulled in and eaten inside the burrow. Molting also
                occurs inside the burrow. Pairs will breed readily and quickly. Females could live an
                approximate 10 to 12 years in captivity.</p>
