                <p><h2>Distribution</h2><br>Brachypelma auratum (also called Mexican flame knee) is a
                tarantula endemic to the regions of Guerrero and Michoac√°n in Mexico. In appearance
                it is reminiscent of the quintessential Mexican red-kneed spider, Brachypelma smithi,
                albeit darker and with more discrete red striations on the patella. The form of these
                red markings have earned the spider its common name, the flame knee. Due to the
                species' similarities to B. smithi, it was not considered a distinct species until
                1992. It has been found living communally with a small frog known as
                Eleutherodactylus occidentalis.</p>
