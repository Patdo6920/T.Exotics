                <p><h3>Pterinochilus Murinus</h3><br> Pterinochilus murinus, is an old-world tarantula that
                was first described in 1897 by Reginald Innes Pocock. This species is found on the
                African continent, in Angola, as well as central, eastern, and southern Africa. It is
                a member of the subfamily Harpactirinae, baboon spiders. Among those who keep tarantulas
                as pets Pterinochilus murinus is known as "OBT", which means "orange baboon tarantula"
                or "orange bitey thing" and also as the "pterror", a pun on its Latin genus classification:
                Pterinochilus. These nicknames reference a particular orange colour form that is prized in the
                hobby for its beauty and confrontational personality. It is also known as the Mombasa golden
                starburst tarantula. This species is incredibly defensive and, as with most old world tarantulas,
                should not be held. The bite of this species, while not serious, is extremely painful. Moreover,
                the species is more than willing to inflict such a bite before presenting the typical threat display.
                Caution when dealing with this species is advised.</p>

                <p><h3>Description</h3><br>Female P. murinus can grow to 4–6 inches (10-15cm) in size (measured
                from the tip of the front left leg, to the tip of the rear right leg), while males typically range
                from 3–4 inches (7.5-10cm). The spider's abdomen, carapace, and legs have the same basic coloration,
                though the legs typically have brightly colored rings. The carapace has a star-shaped pattern, with
                a fishbone pattern present on the abdomen. The eyes are clustered together on a raised part of the
                carapace (in common with all tarantulas). The body is covered with short hairs, with longer hair
                present on the legs. Urticating hairs are not present. </p>

                <p>There are currently 5 known colour variants of Pterinochilus murinus: and also localities of
                those as listed after the color form names.</p>

                <p> <strong>BCF -</strong> Brown Colour Form - Tete, Mozambique<br>
                <strong>DCF -</strong> Dark Colour Form - Botswana/Zimbabwe, Kenya, Kigoma, Mikumi<br>
                <strong>OCF -</strong> Orange Colour Form - Usambara Mountains Region
                (used to be called UMW before RCF was found)<br>
                <strong>RCF -</strong> Red Colour Form - Usambara Mountains Region<br>
                <strong>TCF -</strong> Typical Colour Form - Kenya, Mozambique</p>

                <p><h3>Distribution</h3><br>Pternochilus murinus is found in different parts of Africa and
                has also been recorded on the island of Zanzibar. </p>

                <p><h3>Behavior</h3><br> The orange baboon tarantula is very defensive, and will bite immediately
                if provoked. Consequently, it is not recommended that hobbyists keep this species without extensive
                prior experience handling venomous spiders. The female excavates a burrow, or colonizes an existing
                burrow that has been abandoned.</p>

                <p><h3>As Pets</h3><br>These spiders are not common in pet stores but are very popular in the pet
                trade. These spiders build a tunnel shaped web and as adults should be provided around 20 cm of
                substrate. They are commonly fed crickets, cockroaches, and grasshoppers. Though they can kill
                small vertebrates (mice, small lizards, birds, snakes), these feeder animals are not commonly
                used in captive care. These spiders can be very defensive and are believed to have a very painful
                bite. Although their venom is not known to be lethal to humans, it is considered medically significant
                and thus it is advised to avoid handling this species.</p>
